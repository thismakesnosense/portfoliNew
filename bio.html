        Nathan olenik

            <p>Im a northern VA resident. Born and raised in Prince william county. Graduated from high school in 2007 and 
              joined the army right after. After i got out of the army i used the GI bill to get a degree in computer
              forensics from strayer university. During my last year in college i interned from a company in Orlando FL
              called Ellucian. I was in the data security department and learned a good bit about port scanning and 
              making reports using rapid 7. After the intership was over i moved back to norhtern VA and got married but
              never got back into the IT feild. After my divorce i decided it was time to use my degree so i found this 
              class and enrolled.</p>
